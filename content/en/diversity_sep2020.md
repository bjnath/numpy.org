title: NumPy Diversity and Inclusion Statement, September 2020

_Publication of the September 2020 NumPy paper in
[Nature](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2649-2) sparked concern about
diversity and inclusion in the NumPy team. After review and reflection, we
offer this statement:_


We do best, as a team and community, when we are inclusive and equitable.
We believe this strongly. We have been, from the outset, an international team
whose strength has come from contributors of diverse backgrounds and
expertise.

We want to see, at the core of the NumPy project, a culture where everyone is
welcomed, supported, and valued.

## The Past

For 13 years from its beginning in 2005, NumPy was completely a volunteer
effort. A core team of 4 to 8 sought to meet the project's day-to-day needs;
little thought was given to issues outside the project. Those who made
significant and sustained contributions over those years are the Nature
authors, and their lack of diversity largely mirrors that period in the Python
and SciPy ecosystems.

NumPy changed in 2018 with funding from The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation
and Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. It allowed hiring 2 full-time software
engineers and created space for NumPy to focus on project governance,
community development, and outreach to underrepresented groups.

[The diversity
statement](https://figshare.com/articles/online_resource/Diversity_and_Inclusion_Statement_NumPy_for_Chan_Zuckerberg_Initiative_EOSS_2019_round_1/12980852)
written in mid 2019 for the CZI EOSS program grant application details some of
the challenges as well as the advances in our efforts to bring in more diverse
talent to the NumPy team.

## The Present

The diversity gap in open source is severe and well-documented (see,
for example, the
[2017 GitHub Open Source Survey](https://opensourcesurvey.org/2017/) and
[this blog post](https://medium.com/tech-diversity-files/if-you-think-women-in-tech-is-just-a-pipeline-problem-you-haven-t-been-paying-attention-cb7a2073b996)).

Offering employment opportunities is an effective way to attract and retain
diverse talent. Two-thirds of a second grant that became available in Dec 2019
were used to hire Melissa Weber Mendonça and Mars Lee.

In 2020, NumPy contributions from women and other underrepresented groups have
included:

- **Melissa Weber Mendonça** gained commit rights, is maintaining numpy.f2py,
  and is leading the documentation team;

- **Shaloo Shalini** created all case studies on numpy.org;

- **Mars Lee** contributed web design and led our accessibility improvements work;

- **Isabela Presedo-Floyd** designed our new logo;

- **Stephanie Mendoza**, **Xiayoi Deng**, **Deji Suolang**, and **Mame Fatou Thiam**
  designed and fielded the first NumPy user survey;

- **Yuki Dunn**, **Dayane Machado**, **Mahfuza Humayra Mohona**, **Sumera
  Priyadarsini**, **Shaloo Shalini**, and **Kriti Singh** (former Outreachy
  intern) helped the survey team to reach out to non-English speaking NumPy
  users and developers by translating the questionnaire into their native
  languages;

- **Sayed Adel**, **Raghuveer Devulapalli**, and **Chunlin Fang** are driving
  the work on SIMD optimizations in the core of NumPy.

Though much work remains, the NumPy team is beginning to look more like the
world we serve. You can count on seeing a more diverse author list in our next
paper.

## The Future

Fostering inclusion and diversity on our team and in our community, and doing
our part to build a just and equitable future, is to us a fundamental
commitment.

We welcome engagement with organizations supporting women and minorities in
tech and science. We are ready to listen, learn, and support. Please get in
