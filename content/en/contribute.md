The NumPy project welcomes your expertise and enthusiasm! Your
choices aren't limited to programming -- in addition to

- [Writing code](#writing-code)

you can

- [Review pull requests](#reviewing-pull-requests)
- [Develop tutorials, presentations, and other educational material](#developing-educational-materials)
- [Triage issues](#issue-triaging)
- [Work on our website](#website-development)
- [Contribute graphic design](#graphic-design)
- [Translate website content](#translating-website-content)
- Answer questions on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/numpy/numpy),
  [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/numpy),
  and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Numpy/)
- Participate in [mailing list](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/numpy-discussion) discussions
- [Serve as a community coordinator](#community-coordination-and-outreach)
- [Write grant proposals and help with other fundraising](#fundraising)

If you're unsure where to start or how your skills fit in, _reach out!_ You
can ask on the [mailing
list](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/numpy-discussion) or
[GitHub](http://github.com/numpy/numpy) (open an
[issue](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues) or comment on a relevant
issue).

Those are our preferred channels (open source is open by nature), but
if you prefer to talk privately, contact our community coordinators at
`numpy-team@googlegroups.com` or on [Slack](https://numpy-team.slack.com)
(write  `numpy-team@googlegroups.com` for an invite).

We also have a biweekly _community call_, details of which are announced on
the [mailing list](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/numpy-discussion).
You are very welcome to join.

Our community aspires to treat everyone equally and to value all
contributions. We have a [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct) to foster an open
and welcoming environment.

### Writing code

Programmers, this
[guide](https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/index.html#development-process-summary)
explains how to contribute to the codebase.

### Reviewing pull requests
Even inexperienced contributors can help us deal with our surging PR count
(more than 250 open). A new contributor can:
* tag a stale PR
* summarize a long-running discussion
* triage documentation PRs


### Developing educational materials

NumPy's [User Guide](https://numpy.org/devdocs) is undergoing rehabilitation.
We're in need of new tutorials, how-to's, and deep-dive explanations, and the
site needs restructuring. Opportunities aren't limited to writers. We'd also
welcome worked examples, notebooks, and videos. [NEP 44 â€” Restructuring the
NumPyDocumentation](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0044-restructuring-numpy-docs.html)
lays out our ideas -- and you may have others.


### Issue triaging

The [NumPy issue tracker](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues) has a _lot_
of open issues. Some are no longer valid, some should be prioritized, and some
would make good issues for new contributors.  You can:

* check if older bugs are still present
* find duplicate issues and link related ones
* add good self-contained reproducers to issues
* label issues correctly (this requires triage rights -- just ask)

Please just dive in.


### Website development

We've just revamped our website, but we're far from done. If you love web
development, these
[issues](https://github.com/numpy/numpy.org/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Adesign)
list some of our unmet needs -- and feel free to share your own ideas.


### Graphic design

We've barely begun to think of all the contributions a graphic designer can
make on this site. Our docs are parched for illustration; our growing website
craves images -- opportunities abound.


### Translating website content

We plan multiple translations of [numpy.org](https://numpy.org) to make NumPy
accessible to users in their native language. Volunteer translators, are, of
course, at the heart of this effort.  See
[here](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0028-website-redesign.html#translation-multilingual-i18n)
for background; comment on [this GitHub
issue](https://github.com/numpy/numpy.org/issues/55) to sign up.


### Community coordination and outreach

Through community contact we share our work more widely and learn where we're
falling short. We'd love to get more people involved in efforts like our
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/numpy_team) account, organizing NumPy [code
sprints](https://scisprints.github.io/), a newsletter, and perhaps a blog.

### Fundraising

For most of its history NumPy was all-volunteer, but as the user base grew,
paid staffers were added to ensure the project stayed healthy. [This SciPy'19
talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBTJD_FDVjU) attempts to quantify the
impact of recently received funding and the needs of the project. We have a
number of fundraising ideas and of course we welcome more. Fundraising is a
scarce skill here  -- we'd love your help.
